After completing the assignment, please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

0. Don't forget to also upload your javascript file to the assignment dropbox in I-Learn.

1. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
All pieces are working correctly.

2. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
Working with endpoints was pretty awesome.
Working with URL query parameters was by far the most interesting.

3. Describe anything you did to go above and beyond with this assignment.
I added two endpoints:
1. /games: A redirect-shortcut to my GitHub homepage (ascenderx.github.io)
2. /vigenere: An endpoint that uses a VigenÃ¨re cipher to encrypt and decrypt messages
    -> This endpoint has several possible query parameters, documented in the code's JSDocs

4. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
A - Some attempt was made
B - Developing, but significantly deficient
C - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
D - Meets requirements
E - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements
<E>

5. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I went above and beyond (see #3).
More specifically, I ensured that the query parameters were valid as they were passed into my
/vigenere endpoint, and an error page was displayed if any parameters were invalid.
