After completing the assignment, please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your web application:
http://byui-cs313-downerj.herokuapp.com/index.php

2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
https://github.com/ascenderx/cs313-php

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. Include any special instructions about how to login and/or use your application.
- Navbar: Expand & Collapse to point to Home, Assignments and Github.io
- (Assignments page) Breadcrumbs widget
- (Assignments page) Links to assignment subpages
- (Homepage) PHP/OS Info

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
Everything works as far as I tested.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
Creating the navbar using jQuery was fascinating as well as implementing responsive CSS.

6. What is the difference between an HTTP Get and Post? When should each be used?
Hypothetically, both can be used interchangeably, though there are significant differences:
- `Get` is for requesting information from a server. `Get` should not be used to update the server.
- `Post` is for sending information to a server for it to process and (possibly) update its database.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
A - Some attempt was made
B - Developing, but significantly deficient
C - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
D - Meets requirements
E - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements
< E >

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I included responsive CSS, a custom color scheme, dynamic widgets via PHP and a jQuery navbar.
