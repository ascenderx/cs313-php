5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
PHP is pretty awesome. I never realized it was so easy to throw data around between pages on a server.

6. List one strength and one limitation of using cookies.
Cookies are great because it allows the server to store temporary data on the client's computer for reuse.
However, cookies allow for web tracking and pose privacy issues for the end user.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
A - Some attempt was made
B - Developing, but significantly deficient
C - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
D - Meets requirements

<E>

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I spent over 7 hours on this project, ensuring that the PHP was validated and functional and that the CSS was clean and compliant.
I also added the ability to read the store item data from a JSON file.
