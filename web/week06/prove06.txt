After completing the assignment, please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your web application:
https://byui-cs313-downerj.herokuapp.com

2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
https://github.com/user0x4A35/byui-cs213-downerj.git

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. Include any special instructions about how to login and/or use your application.
- Login
- Get assignment & task lists
- Update/edit task
- Delete task
- Add new task (and cancel during edit)

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
- The login page needs to be forced to HTTPS.
- The timer/scheduler needs to be implemented.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
The coolest thing is that I can create a web app that can serve as a personal database with my own
business rules, GUI and data types.

6. What is a benefit of having a foreign key constraint?
Foreign keys ensure that each row of data is properly linked to its logical counterpart tables.
This is necessary to retain the "relational" nature of the database.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
A - Some attempt was made
B - Developing, but significantly deficient
C - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
D - Meets requirements
E - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements
<E>

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
- I added dynamic-column searching in my PHP modules which allow querying, inserting and updating
regardless of what column names are present in the "tasks" table at any given time (e.g. the column
names aren't hard-coded in my PHP/SQL queries).
- I added a function Timer JavaScript class for use in my scheduler UI.
